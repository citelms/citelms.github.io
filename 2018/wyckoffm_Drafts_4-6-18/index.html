    <h1>Welcome</h1>
    <p>
        My name is Matthew Wyckoff.<br>
        I have been working with computers inside school for about 9 years now.<br>
        Before I entered into high school I never had much interest into computers besides playing games on them.<br>
        However once I chose computers for my career tech classes I decided that this is what I wanted to do.<br>
        From there I went to STCC and graduated with a Computer Systems and Engineering technologies degree.<br>
        The types of classes I attended was classes such as system admin, core classes, and the CISCO curriculum.<br>
    </p>
    <p>
        After I graduated STCC I moved on to a four year degree at Elms.<br>
        I took some more core classes, some graphic arts, but mostly it was classes about computer programming and web design.<br>
        I will be graduating in the spring of 2018 and after that I will start a job for a computer company that I acquired durring the semester.<br>
        
    </p>
    <p>This website was made for my senior capstone class.<br>
    It contains my resume, contact info, and some projects I have done over the couple years I have been at the Elms.<br>
