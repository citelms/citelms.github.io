    <h1>Work History</h1>
    <h2>Six Flags</h2>
    <p>
        My first job that I worked besides mowing the lawn for my neighbor was Six Flags New England.<br>
        It was an ok job to me it was not really a fun job I just needed it so I could pay my car bills.<br>
        I worked there over the summer of 2011 in the entertainment department, so i worked with the costume characters every day.<br>
        It was to me just a job to get money and I did not really like it so i only worked there for one summer.
    </p>
    <h2>Lifecare Centers of Wilbraham</h2>
    <p>
        A few months after I stopped working at Six Flags I was offered a job working in the kitchen at a retirement/rehab center for elderly.<br>
        This job was much more fun for me because while I obviously needed to do the job I was able to talk to the people I worked with<br>
        because they did not need to keep quite since they were in character. I worked this job for a little over three years until one day I<br>
        realized that I needed to leave or I would be there for much longer than I ever wanted to be.
    </p>
    <h2>Aldenville Liquors</h2>
    <p>
        While I was working at Lifecare for a little over 6 moths I also had a second job working at Aldenville Liquor store. When I eventually<br>
        quit Lifecare I took up more hours at the store in order to fill the gap in hours so I could still pay my bills. I am still currently<br>
        At the package store however I will be leaving after I graduate because durring my final semester at college I accepted a job offer<br>
        at a computer company for when I have my degree.
    </p>
    <h2>Future</h2>
    <p>
        My plan is to work at the company I have lined up for when I graduate. I plan on working there for a while and I know I will learn<br>
        a great many things. As for where things go now, I have no idea but I am excited to start a life of my own.
